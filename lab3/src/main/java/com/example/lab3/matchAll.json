Aimed primarily at gamers, tomorrow morning AMD will be releasing a pair of their latest-generation Ryzen 7000 chips with the extra cache stacked on, including the Ryzen 9 7950X3D (16C/32T) & amp;nbsp;and the Ryzen 7 7900X3D (12C/24T). Both chips build upon their Ryzen 7000X-series predecessors by adding a further 64MB of L3 cache, bringing them to an impressive total of 128 MB of L3 & amp;nbsp;cache.</p>  <p>Meanwhile, a third SKU, the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D, is in the works for April 6th. That part will offer 8 CPU cores and 96 MB of L3 cache, making it the most direct successor to the Ryzen 7 5800X3D.</p>  <p>Ultimately, all three chips will serve to update AMD & amp;#39;s product stack by combining the strengths of the Zen 4 CPU architecture with the performance benefits of the extra L3 cache, which during the overlapping period of the last several months, has been split between the Ryzen 5000 and Ryzen 7000 families. In short, PC gamers will finally be able to have their cake and eat it too, gaining access to AMD & amp;#39;s Zen 4 microarchitecture and its myriad of benefits (higher IPC, higher clockspeeds, DDR5, PCIe 5) with a nice helping of additional L3 cache slathered on top.</p>  <p>From that stack, today we & amp;#39;re reviewing the new flagship Ryzen 9 7950X3D. The 7950X3D offers 16 Zen 4 cores spread over two CCDs (8C/16T per CCD). AMD had to elect one of the CCDs to stack the additional L3 cache onto, resulting in a new-to-AMD heterogeneous CPU design, but & amp;nbsp;they do have some special & amp;nbsp;sauce as a garnish to make it work. We aim to determine if the Ryzen 9 7950X3D is the chip gamers have been yearning for and how it stacks up against other Ryzen 7000 chips (and Intel & amp;#39;s 13th Gen) in our test suite.</p> <p align=\"center\"><a href='http://dynamic1.anandtech.com/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a1f2f01f & amp;amp;cb=135505679' target='_blank'><img src='http://dynamic1.anandtech.com/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=24 & amp;amp;cb=135505679 & amp;amp;n=a1f2f01f' border='0' alt='' /></a><img src=\"http: //toptenreviews.122.2o7.net/b/ss/tmn-test/1/H.27.3--NS/0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" /></p>]]>",

The company has put together a 1100 Watt, ATX 3.0 compliant unit that fits entirely within the SFX form factor for compact PCs. The resulting PSU is by far the most power-dense unit we & amp;#39;ve ever reviewed, and is a significant feat of engineering in and of itself.</p>  <p>But Cooler Master and their OEM, Sysgration, are also testing the practical limits of the SFX form factor with their design. Even with no cubic inch wasted, regulating over a kilowatt of energy  & amp;ndash; and spiking as high as two kilowatts  & amp;ndash; is a lot of work for such a small power supply. So Cooler Master has needed to make some trade-offs here in terms of price and power quality in order to meet their overall power delivery requirements, resulting in a PSU that does well at delivering raw power, but it & amp;#39;s especially well-rounded overall.</p> ]]>",

However, cooling requirements have made it difficult for vendors to bring effective M.2 NVMe Gen 5 SSDs to the market. In that context, it appears that Gen 4 M.2 SSDs will continue to have a much longer runway than was previously estimated. In order to better serve that market segment, Silicon Motion is introducing a new product in their PCIe 4.0-capable NVMe SSD controller lineup. The company & amp;#39;s roadmap is not much of a secret, as we do expect their Gen 5 client controllers to land in Q4 2023 - in fact, an end product based on it from ADATA was already demonstrated by ADATA at the 2023 CES. However, today marks the official launch date for the SM2268XT - the third-generation DRAM-less Gen 4 SSD controller meant to play in the entry-level segment in terms of pricing, but move to the high end in terms of performance .</p>  <p>The key updates in the SM2268XT over the SM2267XT and SM2269XT are the increase in the per-channel data rate from 1600 MT/s to 3200 MT/s and support for the latest 2xx layer 3D TLC (as well as QLC) from different flash vendors. The new controller also brings in support for some NVMe 2.0 features (compared to NVMe 1.4 in the SM2267XT and SM2269XT). Like the SM2269XT, the LDPC engine codeword size in the SM2268XT is also 4KB (compared to 2KB in the SM2267XT). The move to a 12nm process also brings in better power efficiency.</p>  <p>THE SM2268XT will be competing against in-house controllers from Western Digital (such as the one used in the WD_BLACK SN770), and the upcoming Phison E21T as well as InnoGrit & amp;#39;s RainierQX IG5220. The claimed performance numbers across all four corners for the SM2268XT are leading in its class.</p>  <table align=\"center\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\"> <tbody> <tr class=\"tgrey\"> <td colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; \">Silicon Motion Client/Consumer Gen 4 NVMe SSD Controllers</td> </tr> <tr class=\"tlblue\"> <td style=\"width: 15%\"> & amp;nbsp;</td> <td style=\"width: 17%\">SM2264</td> <td style=\"width: 17%\">SM2267</td> <td style=\"width: 17%\">SM2267XT</td> <td style=\"width: 17%\">SM2269XT</td> <td style=\"width: 17%\">SM2268XT</td> </tr> <tr> <td class=\"tlgrey\" style=\"vertical-align: middle; \">Market Segment</td> <td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align: center;vertical-align: middle; \">High-End Consumer</td> <td colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align: center;vertical-align: middle; \">Mainstream Consumer</td> </tr> <tr> <td class=\"tlgrey\">Manufacturing<br /> Process</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;vertical-align: middle; \">12nm</td> <td colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;vertical-align: middle; \">28nm</td> <td colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;vertical-align: middle; \">12nm</td> </tr> <tr> <td class=\"tlgrey\">Arm CPU Cores</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">4x ARM Cortex R8</td> <td colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\">2x ARM Cortex R5</td> <td colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\">2x ARM Cortex R8</td> </tr> <tr> <td class=\"tlgrey\">Error Correction</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">4KB LDPC</td> <td colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\">2KB LDPC</td> <td colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\">4KB LDPC</td> </tr> <tr> <td class=\"tlgrey\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"vertical-align: middle; \">DRAM Support</td> <td rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align: center;vertical-align: middle; \">DDR4, LPDDR4(X)</td> <td rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align: center;vertical-align: middle; \">DDR3, DDR3L, LPDDR3, DDR4, LPDDR4</td> <td colspan=\"3\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align: center;vertical-align: middle; \">None / HMB</td> </tr> <tr> <td class=\"tlgrey\">Host Interface</td> <td colspan=\"5\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align: center;\">PCIe 4.0 x4</td> </tr> <tr> <td class=\"tlgrey\" rowspan=\"1\">NAND Channels, Interface Speed</td> <td rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align: center;vertical-align: middle; \">8ch<br /> 1600 MT/s</td> <td rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align: center;vertical-align: middle; \">8ch<br /> 1200 MT/s</td> <td rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align: center;vertical-align: middle; \">4ch<br /> 1200 MT/s</td> <td rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align: center;vertical-align: middle; \">4ch<br /> 1600 MT/s</td> <td rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align: center;vertical-align: middle; \">4ch<br /> 3200 MT/s</td> </tr> <tr> <td class=\"tlgrey\">CEs per Channel</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">8</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">8</td> <td colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center;\">4</td> </tr> <tr> <td class=\"tlgrey\">Sequential Read</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;vertical-align: middle; \">7500 MB/s</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;vertical-align: middle; \">3900 MB/s</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;vertical-align: middle; \">3500 MB/s</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;vertical-align: middle; \">5100 MB/s</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;vertical-align: middle; \">7400 MB/s</td> </tr> <tr> <td class=\"tlgrey\">Sequential Write</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;vertical-align: middle; \">7000 MB/s</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;vertical-align: middle; \">3500 MB/s</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;vertical-align: middle; \">3000 MB/s</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;vertical-align: middle; \">4800 MB/s</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;vertical-align: middle; \">6500 MB/s</td> </tr> <tr> <td class=\"tlgrey\">4KB Random Read IOPS</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;vertical-align: middle; \">1.3M</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;vertical-align: middle; \">500K</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;vertical-align: middle; \">500K (HMB) / 200K (No HMB)</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;vertical-align: middle; \">900K</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;vertical-align: middle; \">1.2M</td> </tr> <tr> <td class=\"tlgrey\">4KB Random Write IOPS</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;vertical-align: middle; \">1.2M</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;vertical-align: middle; \">500K</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;vertical-align: middle; \">500K</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;vertical-align: middle; \">900K</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;vertical-align: middle; \">1.2M</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>  <p>The company indicates that the SM2268XT is currently sampling to its key customers and the launch of SSDs based on it should be imminent.

Between the de facto retirement of Intel & amp;rsquo;s desktop-grade Xeon W-1x00-series lineup, and the repeated delays of Intel & amp;rsquo;s current-generation big silicon parts for servers, the Sapphire Rapids-based 4<sup>th</sup> Generation Xeon Scalable series, there hasn & amp;rsquo;t been much noise from Intel in the workstation space in the last few years. But now that Sapphire Rapids for servers has finally launched, the logjam in Intel & amp;rsquo;s product roadmap has at last cleared out, and Intel is finally in a position to resume cascading their latest silicon into new workstation parts.</p>  <p>This morning Intel is announcing their first top-to-bottom refresh of workstation parts, the Xeon W-3400 and Xeon W-2400 series. Aimed at what Intel is broadly classifying as the Expert Workstation and Mainstream Workstation markets respectively, these chip lineups are intended for use in high-performance desktop workstation setups, particularly those that require more CPU cores, more PCIe lanes, more memory bandwidth, or a combination of all three elements. Based on the same Sapphire Rapids silicon as Intel & amp;rsquo;s recently-launched server parts, the new Xeon W SKUs will bring down many (but not all) of the features that have come to define Intel & amp;rsquo;s leading-edge server silicon, along with a new chipset and motherboards that are more suitable for use in high-performance workstations.</p> ]]>",

The 22 TB My Book is priced at $600 (commensurate with the pricing of the bare 22 TB drives introduced last year), while the 44 TB My Book Duo is priced at $1500. A $300 premium for a RAID-0 / RAID-1 controller and a couple of downstream USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A ports appears very steep, but that is the premium the company expects early adopters to pay (and is par for the course, based on how the previous My Book Duo SKUs were priced at launch). The single HDD My Book looks to be a cost-effective solution for consumers looking for an off-the-shelf backup solution with high capacity requirements.</p> </p>]]>",

Being the first to market with the latest platforms has been one of the key reasons behind this. In 2022, the company had launched the Intel Alder Lake and AMD Cezanne UCFF systems together, with the NUC BOX-1200 series and the 4X4 BOX-5000 series becoming available for purchase within a few weeks of each other. Earlier this year, the Intel Raptor Lake-based NUC BOX-1300 series was launched (our <a href=\"https://www.anandtech.com/show/18732/asrock-industrial-nucs-box1360pd4-review-raptor-lakep-ecc\">review</a>) and is already available for purchase. The company recently took the wraps off the 4X4 BOX 7000/D5 series based on AMD & amp;#39;s low-power Rembrandt-R APUs. These APUs sport Zen 3+ cores along with a RDNA2 iGPU fabricated on a TSMC 6nm process.</p>  <p>One of the key updates in the new 4X4 BOX systems is the move to DDR5 SODIMMs. The other updates in the platform such as support for a PCIe 4.0 x4 M.2 NVMe SSD and USB4 40 Gbps bring it almost on par with the premium UCFF systems based on Intel processors. Full-fledged USB4 support inclusive of PCIe tunneling has been somewhat of a hit or miss on AMD platforms, as many OEMs have refrained from integrating the necessary board components to enable it. AMD itself had some work to do on the firmware side before the feature baked into the hardware of Rembrandt and later APUs could be enabled. The good news here is that the ASRock Industrial 4X4 BOX 7000/D5 series has two USB4 ports capable of supporting DisplayPort 1.4 signals as well as PCIe tunneling - this means that Thunderbolt 3 peripherals should work when connected to those Type-C ports.</p>  <p>The 4X4 BOX 7000/D5 series comes in two flavors. The specifications of both models are summarized in the table below.</p>  <table style=\"width: 100%;\"> <tbody> <tr class=\"tgrey\"> <td align=\"center\" colspan=\"4\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\">ASRock Industrial 4X4 BOX 7000/D5 (Rembrandt-R) Lineup</td> </tr> <tr align=\"center\" class=\"tlblue\"> <td colspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\">Model</td> <td rowspan=\"1\" style=\"vertical-align: middle; width: 40%;\">4X4 BOX-7735U/D5</td> <td rowspan=\"1\" style=\"vertical-align: middle; width: 40%;\">4X4 BOX-7535U/D5</td> </tr> <tr> <td class=\"tlgrey\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\">CPU</td> <td align=\"center\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\">AMD Ryzen 7 7735U<br /> 8C / 16T<br /> 2.7 GHz (Up to 4.75 GHz)<br /> 28W</td> <td align=\"center\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\">AMD Ryzen 5 7535U<br /> 6C / 12T<br /> 2.9 GHz (Up to 4.55 GHz)<br /> 28W</td> </tr> <tr> <td class=\"tlgrey\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\">GPU</td> <td align=\"center\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\">AMD Radeon 680M<br /> (12 CU / 768 Shaders) @ 2.2 GHz</td> <td align=\"center\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\">AMD Radeon 660M<br /> (6 CU / 384 Shaders) @ 1.9 GHz</td> </tr> <tr> <td class=\"tlgrey\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\">DRAM</td> <td align=\"center\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\">Two DDR5 SO-DIMM slots<br /> Up to 64 GB of DDR5-4800 in dual-channel mode</td> </tr> <tr> <td class=\"tlgrey\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\">Motherboard</td> <td align=\"center\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\">4.02 & amp;quot; x 4.09 & amp;quot; UCFF</td> </tr> <tr> <td class=\"tlgrey\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\">Storage</td> <td class=\"tlgrey\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\">SSD</td> <td align=\"center\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\">1x M.2-22(42/60/80) (PCIe 4.0 x4 (CPU-direct))</td> </tr> <tr> <td class=\"tlgrey\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\">DFF</td> <td align=\"center\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\">1  & amp;times; SATA III Port (for 2.5 & amp;quot; drive)</td> </tr> <tr> <td class=\"tlgrey\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\">Wireless</td> <td align=\"center\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\">Mediatek MT7922 (RZ616)?

Besides offering plenty of power, the MEG Ai1300P was also MSI & amp;#39;s first ATX 3.0 power supplies  & amp;ndash; and one of the first ATX 3.0 PSUs on the market overall. And while it was admittedly not a groundbreaking design overall, it was still a seminal work of sorts, sketching out a rough picture of what we should expect from other ATX 3.0 PSU designs, including MSI & amp;#39;s own.</p>  <p>The MEG Ai1300P was a true flagship PSU, for all the pros and cons that come with that. As impressive as it was overall, it was also aimed at those willing and able to deal with the hefty price tag. This is all well and good for the small fraction of the market that can afford such a high caliber PSU, but for most PC builders, budgets are a very real thing.</p>  <p>So, for today & amp;rsquo;s review, we are taking a look at something a little more downmarket from MSI: their MPG series. Like their flagship units, the new MPG PSUs are also are ATX 3.0 Ready, but they come at more reasonable prices. Despite that shift, the unit we & amp;#39;re testing today, the MPG A1000G, is still one of the most powerful PSUs MSI offers (as well as being the top MPG unit), capable of delivering a kilowatt of PC power.</p> ]]>",

This includes not only the 5800X3D & amp;rsquo;s direct successor, the 8 core Ryzen 7 7800X3D, but also, for the first time, chips employing multiple CCDs. These are the Ryzen 9 7900X3D and 7950X3D, which will offer 12 and 16 CPU cores, respectively.</p>  <p>Interestingly, AMD has gone for a non-homogenous design for these multi-CCD parts  & amp;ndash; rather than giving both CCDs V-Cache, AMD is only outfitting one of the CCDs with the extra L3 cache. The other CCD will remain a plain Zen 4 CCD, with its integrated 32MB of L3 cache. The unbalanced design, besides allowing AMD to control the costs of what & amp;rsquo;s still a relatively expensive technology to implement, will allow AMD to offer something close to the best of both worlds for their multi-CCD parts. The V-Cache equipped Zen 4 CCDs will offer 6 or 8 CPU cores backed by the massive L3 pool, for tasks that benefit from the larger cache size, while the vanilla Zen 4 CCDs will be unencumbered by the V-Cache, allowing them to clock higher for pure throughput workloads that wouldn & amp;rsquo;t benefit from the extra cache.</p>  <p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://www.anandtech.com/show/18737/amds-ryzen-7000x3d-chips-releasing-february-28th-and-april-6th\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://images.anandtech.com/doci/18737/AMD%20CES%202023%20-%20Client%20Processors%20Press%20Deck_40_575px.png\" /></a></p>  <p>As with the original 5800X3D, AMD is aiming these chips at gamers in particular, as the complex, heavy-dataset nature of video games means they often benefit from having additional L3 cache on-hand. The 5800X3D was, depending on the game, around 15% faster than its vanilla Ryzen counterpart  & amp;ndash; at least so long as it wasn & amp;rsquo;t GPU limited. AMD is being a bit more coy this time around on making apples-to-apples comparisons against their regular Ryzen 7000 chips, so for now the only official performance figures available from AMD are pitting the chips against the 5800X3D. In lieu of that, a 15% improvement is a reasonable baseline given that the cache sizes haven & amp;rsquo;t changed in the last generation, but we & amp;rsquo;ll definitely want to take a closer look at the final chips to see if the additional L3 cache is as beneficial to Zen 4 as it was for Zen 3.</p>  <p>Back at their CES 2023 keynote, AMD announced the specifications for two-and-a-half of the chips, as well as an undetailed February launch date. With today & amp;rsquo;s announcement, AMD is finally filling in the rest of the details, as well as confirming that only part of the product stack is going to make that February launch date.</p>  <p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://www.anandtech.com/show/18737/amds-ryzen-7000x3d-chips-releasing-february-28th-and-april-6th\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://images.anandtech.com/doci/18737/7950X3D%20Die_575px.jpg\" /></a><br /> <em>(Image Courtesy <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-unveils-three-ryzen-7000x3d-v-cache-chips-three-new-65w-non-x-cpus-too\">Tom & amp;#39;s Hardware</a></em>)</p>  <p>As previously noted, the Ryzen 9 7950X3D and Ryzen 9 7900X3D both launch on February 28<sup>th</sup>. The 16 core 7950X3D will hit the streets with a $699 price tag, while the 12 core 7900X3D will intro at $599. At current street prices, this represents roughly a $100 to $150 premium over the chips & amp;rsquo; regular counterparts, with the 7950X selling for around <a href=\"https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=45726 & amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FAMD-7950X-32-Thread-Unlocked-Processor%2Fdp%2FB0BBHD5D8Y%3Fth%3D1%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Danandtech-us-1327878356486651400-20\">$583</a>, and the 7900X selling for around <a href=\"https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=45726 & amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FAMD-7900X-24-Thread-Unlocked-Processor%2Fdp%2FB0BBJ59WJ4%3Fth%3D1%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Danandtech-us-6231689756408712000-20\">$444</a>. Prices on AMD & amp;rsquo;s top AM5 chips have come down a decent bit since their 2022 launch, so the new X3D SKUs are coming in at similar launch prices as their non V-Cache counterparts. Put another way, whereas $699 would get you a 16 core 7950X in September, come February it will get you the same chip with an additional 64MB of L3 cache.</p>  <p>Other than benchmarks, at this point the only detail we don & amp;rsquo;t have on the 7950X3D and 7900X3D are the clockspeeds for the V-Cache equipped CCDs. AMD & amp;rsquo;s quoted turbo clockspeeds are for the vanilla CCD, so it & amp;rsquo;s unclear just how much clockspeeds have been lowered for the V-Cache CCD. But taking a hint from AMD & amp;rsquo;s sole single CCD X3D part, the 7800X3D, we see that part has a top clockspeed of just 5.0GHz. So we & amp;rsquo;d expect something similar for the V-Cache CCDs on the Ryzen 9 parts.</p>  <p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://www.anandtech.com/show/18737/amds-ryzen-7000x3d-chips-releasing-february-28th-and-april-6th\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://images.anandtech.com/doci/18737/AMD_Price_Slide_575px.png\" /></a></p>  <p>Speaking of the Ryzen 7 7800X3D, we finally have the full specifications on AMD & amp;rsquo;s most straightforward X3D part. Back in January AMD hadn & amp;rsquo;t locked down the base clockspeeds on this part, but as of today we finally have the answer: 4.2GHz. The chip will, in turn, be able to turbo as high as 5.0GHz as previously noted.</p>  <p>The cheapest of the Z3D parts, with a price tag of $449, the 7800X3D will also be the laggard of the group, with the chip not launching until April 6<sup>th</sup>. AMD has not explained the gap in launch dates, but it & amp;rsquo;s reasonable to assume that AMD is prioritizing the assembly and shipping of their more expensive Ryzen 9 SKUs. In any case, at current street prices the 7800X3D will carry a $150 premium over the <a href=\"https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=45726 & amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FAMD-7700X-16-Thread-Unlocked-Processor%2Fdp%2FB0BBHHT8LY%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Danandtech-us-3725827067875564000-20\">$299</a> 7700X, making it a full 50% more expensive, assuming these street prices hold through April. This happens to be the same price the 5800X3D launched at, so AMD is technically just holding the line here, but it does underscore how price cuts on the rest of the Ryzen 7000 lineup have made the standard chips very competitive on a price/performance basis.</p>  <p>In any case, we & amp;rsquo;ll have more on AMD & amp;rsquo;s first V-Cache equipped Zen 4 chips later this month. Besides taking an in-depth look at the performance improvements brought about by the larger L3 cache, the other major factor driving performance is going to be the Windows thread scheduler. As this is AMD & amp;rsquo;s first asymmetric Ryzen CPU, it will be up to Windows and AMD & amp;rsquo;s chipset driver to figure out which CCD to place threads on for the 7950X3D/7900X3D. So this month & amp;rsquo;s launch is going to require that AMD & amp;rsquo;s hardware and software offerings are in sync in order for the company to make a good first impression.</p> ]]>",

The & amp;nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.westerndigital.com/en-us/products/internal-drives/data-center-drives/ultrastar-dc-hs760-hdd?cjevent=0e5668f4a14111ed808ec3dd0a18b8f9 & amp;amp;utm_medium=afl1 & amp;amp;utm_source=cj & amp;amp;utm_content=Data+Recovery+-+US & amp;amp;cp1=8900246 & amp;amp;utm_campaign=datarecovery-us & amp;amp;utm_term=04-11-2022 & amp;amp;cp2=Future+Publishing+Limited#ultrastar-dc-hs760-20-tb\">Ultrastar DC HS760 drive</a> & amp;nbsp;is meant to increase IOPS-per-terabyte performance for hyperscale cloud datacenters and will compete against Seagate & amp;#39;s dual actuator Exos 2X family of HDDs. Meanwhile, Western Digital & amp;#39;s offering will also mark the latest deployment of the company & amp;#39;s OptiNAND technology.</p>  <p>The dual actuator Ultrastar DC HS760 HDD builds upon the company & amp;#39;s single actuator Ultrastar DC HC560 drive which uses nine 2.2TB ePMR (energy-assisted perpendicular magnetic recording) platters. But in the case of the HS760, WD adds a second actuator to the drive, essentially splitting it up into two quasi-independent drives with each half having domain over 4.5 platters (9 surfaces). By doubling the number of indepent actuators, Western Digital claims that the HS760 is able to double sequential read/write speeds and increase random read/write performance by 1.7 times versus single actuator drives.</p>  <p>While the company yet has to upload a datasheet for its dual actuator HDD, we are looking at sequential throughput rates of around 582 MB/s, which interestingly enough is a tad faster than SATA SSDs, which max out the SATA-III at around 550 MB/s. Though it & amp;#39;s worth noting that, as is typical for enterprise-focused hard drives, Western Digital is using Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) here, so it won & amp;#39;t be possible to hook the drive up to a SATA host.</p>  <p>Since the two actuators inside Western Digital & amp;#39;s Ultrastar DC HS760 HDD work independently, the unit presents itself as two independent logical unit number (LUN) devices, and both logical hard drives are independently addressable. This means that datacenters will have to introduce certain software tweaks (i.e., these are not drop-in compatible with infrastructure designed for single actuator HDDs). But for the added complexity on the software/configuration side of matters, data center operators are being promised not only the aforementioned higher performance levels, but also a setup that is 37% more energy efficient in terms of IOPS-per-Watt than two 10TB devices. & amp;nbsp; In essence, hyperscalers are getting many of the benefits of having two current-generation 10TB HDDs, but in a product that takes up the space of just a single drive.</p>  <p>The key advantage of Western Digital & amp;#39;s Ultrastar DC HS760 20TB over hard drives with one actuator of the same capacity is significantly increased & amp;nbsp;performance on an IOPS-per-TB basis. Typical enterprise-grade 3.5-inch HDDs with capacities between 8TB and 16TB offer random performance of 6  & amp;ndash; 10 IOPS per terabyte, which is enough to ensure quality-of-service of datacenters. But at 20TB, random performance drops to less than 5 IOPS per terabyte, which requires hyperscalers to introduce various mitigations to ensure that these drives meet their QoS requirements.</p>  <p>Such mitigations either include implementing command queuing and latency-bounded I/O (LBIO) in firmware, usage of drives of lower capacity, reducing usable capacity per drive, or even adding sophisticated caching methods. All of these methods either increase upfront costs and/or total-costs-of-ownership. Therefore, hyperscalers need drives that can physically increase their IOPS-per-terabyte performance and dual actuator HDDs are a natural answer. As an added bonus, these hard drives also offer two times higher sequential read/write speeds than single-actuator HDDs.</p>  <p>As noted above, Western Digital is not the only company to offer dual actuator HDDs as Seagate has been doing this for years now. But Western Digital & amp;#39;s Ultrastar DC HS760 has an advantage over rivals that comes in the form of its & amp;nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.anandtech.com/show/16920/western-digital-reimagines-hdd-flash-integration-with-optinand\">OptiNAND</a> & amp;nbsp;technology, which is an integrated iNAND UFS embedded flash drive (EFD) coupled with firmware tweaks. OptiNAND is meant to increase capacity, reliability, and performance of HDDs and while Western Digital yet has to disclose performance numbers of its Ultrastar DC HS760 drives, it is at least evident that its 20TB drive will offer more capacity than Seagate & amp;#39;s competing Exos 2X18 18TB drive.</p>  <p>Otherwise, given that the HS760 is aimed primarily at hyperscalers, Western Digital is treating the drive as a product for a limited audience. Although the drive is listed on the company & amp;#39;s website, for example, there is no public pricing listed, and buyers will have to make a sales inquiry. So the actual unit pricing on the new drive is going to vary some, depending on things like order volumes and agreements between Western Digital and its clients.</p>  <p>Western Digital & amp;#39;s Ultrastar DC HS760 HDD will be covered with a five-year warranty with each LUN rated for a 500 TB annual workload.</p> </p>]]>",
